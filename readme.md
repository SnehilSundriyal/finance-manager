# Personal Finance Manager
The repository for a Personal Finance Management API made in Go version 1.24.2. I use it to keep track of my own finances, and you can too!


- I can track my own finances personally without having to share my data with a third party manager.
- Uses the [Gin framework](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin). What is Gin? Gin is a HTTP web framework written in Go (Golang). It features a Martini-like API, but with performance up to 40 times faster than Martini.
